Another game from DINAMIC boys.
This time, it is a conversational game, based in one of the jewels of the
Spanish literature: Don Quijote de la Mancha.
The game is in spanish, so you will learn a bit about this great language :-)

If you get stuck in part I, take the book.
The password (clave) for part II is {BEL INGENIOSO HIDALGO}B

No POKEs, but.. why do you want POKEs in a conversational game??
I know the solution, and is 90 lines long. e-mail me for it.
